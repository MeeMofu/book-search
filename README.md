## Description

This web application is a revamp of an existed book search. The server was modified to behave as a Graphql server rather than a typical REST API server, providing faster data for its users. The client, which is a responsive react app, was also modified to accommodate the changes.

There's also minor fixies so that the books are stored more consistently (as I've noticed some books failed to store in localmemory)
